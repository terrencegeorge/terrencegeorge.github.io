abstract={Groves are spanning forests of a finite region of the triangular lattice that are in bijection with Laurent monomials that arise in solutions of the cube recurrence. We introduce a large class of probability measures on groves for which we can compute exact generating functions for edge probabilities. Using the machinery of asymptotics of multivariate generating functions, this lets us explicitly compute arctic curves, generalizing the arctic circle theorem of Petersen and Speyer. Our class of probability measures is sufficiently general that the limit shapes exhibit all solid and gaseous phases expected from the classification of ergodic Gibbs measures in the resistor network model.},

abstract={Associated to a convex integral polygon $N$ is a  cluster integrable system $\mathcal X_N$ constructed from the dimer model. We compute the group $G_N$ of symmetries of $\mathcal X_N$, called the (2-2) cluster modular group, showing that it is a certain abelian group conjectured by Fock and Marshakov. Combinatorially, non-torsion elements of $G_N$ are ways of shuffling the underlying bipartite graph, generalizing domino-shuffling. Algebro-geometrically, $G_N$ is a subgroup of the Picard group of a certain algebraic surface associated to $N$.},

abstract={Cluster integrable systems are a broad class of integrable systems modelled on bipartite dimer models on the torus. Many discrete integrable dynamics arise by applying sequences of local transformations, which form the cluster modular group of the cluster integrable system. This cluster modular group was recently characterized by George and Inchiostro. There exist some discrete integrable dynamics that make use of non-local transformations associated with geometric $R$-matrices. In this article we characterize the generalized cluster modular group -- which includes both local and non-local transformations -- in terms of extended affine symmetric groups. We also describe the action of the generalized cluster modular group on the spectral data associated with cluster integrable systems.},

abstract={A biperiodic planar resistor network is a pair $(G,c)$ where $G$ is a graph embedded on the torus and $c$ is a function from the edges of $G$ to non-zero complex numbers. Associated with the discrete Laplacian on a biperiodic planar network is its spectral data: a triple $(C,S,\nu)$,  where $C$ is a curve, and $S$ is a divisor on it, which we show is a point in the Prym variety of $C$. We give a complete classification of networks (modulo a natural equivalence) in terms of their spectral data. The space of networks has a large group of cluster automorphisms arising from the Y-$\Delta$ transformation, giving discrete cluster integrable systems. We show that these automorphisms are integrable in the algebro-geometric sense: under the spectral transform, they become translations in the Prym variety.},
