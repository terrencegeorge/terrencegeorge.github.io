<p>I work on problems in the intersection of combinatorics, algebraic geometry and probability. I am a Postdoctoral Assistant Professor at the University of Michigan where my mentor is <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~speyer/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">David Speyer</a>. I received my PhD from Brown University in 2020 advised by <a href="https://gauss.math.yale.edu/~rwk25/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Rick Kenyon</a>.</p>
