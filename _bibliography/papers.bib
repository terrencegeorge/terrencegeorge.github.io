abstract={Cluster integrable systems are a broad class of integrable systems modelled on bipartite dimer models on the torus. Many discrete integrable dynamics arise by applying sequences of local transformations, which form the cluster modular group of the cluster integrable system. This cluster modular group was recently characterized by George and Inchiostro. There exist some discrete integrable dynamics that make use of non-local transformations associated with geometric $R$-matrices. In this article we characterize the generalized cluster modular group -- which includes both local and non-local transformations -- in terms of extended affine symmetric groups. We also describe the action of the generalized cluster modular group on the spectral data associated with cluster integrable systems.},

abstract={Associated to a convex integral polygon $N$ is a  cluster integrable system $$\mathcal{X}_N$$ constructed from the dimer model. We compute the group $G_N$ of symmetries of $\mathcal X_N$, called the (2-2) cluster modular group, showing that it is a certain abelian group conjectured by Fock and Marshakov. Combinatorially, non-torsion elements of $G_N$ are ways of shuffling the underlying bipartite graph, generalizing domino-shuffling. Algebro-geometrically, $G_N$ is a subgroup of the Picard group of a certain algebraic surface associated to $N$. },

abstract={Groves are spanning forests of a finite region of the triangular lattice that are in bijection with Laurent monomials that arise in solutions of the cube recurrence. We introduce a large class of probability measures on groves for which we can compute exact generating functions for edge probabilities. Using the machinery of asymptotics of multivariate generating functions, this lets us explicitly compute arctic curves, generalizing the arctic circle theorem of Petersen and Speyer. Our class of probability measures is sufficiently general that the limit shapes exhibit all solid and gaseous phases expected from the classification of ergodic Gibbs measures in the resistor network model.},

abstract={We construct an electrical-network version of the twist map for the positive Grassmannian, and use it to solve the inverse problem of recovering conductances from the response matrix.  Each conductance is expressed as a biratio of Pfaffians as in the inverse map of Kenyon and Wilson; however, our Pfaffians are the more canonical $B$ variables instead of their tripod variables, and are coordinates on the positive orthogonal Grassmannian studied by Henriques and Speyer.},
