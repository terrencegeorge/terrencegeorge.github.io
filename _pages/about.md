I work on problems in the intersection of combinatorics, algebraic geometry and probability. I am a Hedrick Assistant Adjunct Professor at UCLA where my mentor is [Pavel Galashin](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~galashin/). 

I received my PhD from Brown University in 2020 advised by [Rick Kenyon](https://gauss.math.yale.edu/~rwk25/) and was a Postdoctoral Assistant Professor at the University of Michigan from 2020 to 2023 where my mentor was [David Speyer](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~speyer/).
