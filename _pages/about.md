I am a Postdoctoral Associate at MIT where my mentor is [Alexei Borodin](https://math.mit.edu/directory/profile.html?pid=1222). My research lies at the interface of mathematical physics, combinatorics, geometry and probability. Recently, I have been working on discrete integrable systems, total positivity and discrete differential geometry.

I received my PhD from Brown University in 2020 advised by [Rick Kenyon](https://gauss.math.yale.edu/~rwk25/). I was a Postdoctoral Assistant Professor at the University of Michigan from 2020 to 2023 where my mentor was [David Speyer](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~speyer/) and a Hedrick Assistant Adjunct Professor at UCLA from 2023 to 2025 where my mentor was [Pavel Galashin](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~galashin/).

I am on the job market in the Fall of 2026. Here is my [CV](CV2.pdf) and [Research Statement](RS3.pdf).
