I am a postdoc at the University of Michigan where my mentor is [David Speyer](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~speyer/). I work on problems in the intersection of combinatorics, algebraic geometry and probability. I received my PhD from Brown University in 2020 advised by [Rick Kenyon](https://gauss.math.yale.edu/~rwk25/).
